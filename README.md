# Welcome to misinfo sim! 

This project is an attempt to create a simulation of how misinformation spreads on social media, trying to find ways of making social media more robust to misinformation. 

Our goal is to create social media structures that help spread of good ideas, while making it harder to spread bad ideas.

The scope of this project is not just limited to political misinformation but rather attempts to mislead people online in general. One of the primary use cases being explored is as an ethical advertising platform. 

Misinformation in this project means any information presented by a source that has some goal separate from simply informing the listener. For instance, in games like [mafia, warewolf, or among-us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), information from other players is potential misinformation because they might be on the other team, trying to decieve you.

Here is the high level structure of our sim
